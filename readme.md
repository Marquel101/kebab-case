## Project Description

Tough Talk is a fun an interactive website where you can see all the different views people have on certain topics. We offer a wide variety of discussion topics for you to choose from. We even offer you the ability to input your own opinions! Using an Airtable API you get to submit your own api based on the available categories we have.

## SWOT Analysis

### Strengths:

I have a good understanding of what i want my application to look like and what exactly I want it to do. As such, I can better plan for what needs to be done and how long it will take. I also know which labs and exercise I can reference if I get lost along the way.

### Weaknesses:

Params is still kinda tricky to me so I know this will be the week I have to solidify my understanding of it. Also I fear loops are going to be needed and Lord knows I can't stand using those.

### Opportunities:

My last project was garbage according to my standards, so this is a chance to redeem and push myself. Plus I think it'll be something I can have fun doing along the way.

### Threats:

Getting to caught up on one thing without asking for help or seeking other ways or methods for doing what I want. Also asking for help when needed so I can stay on schedule.
